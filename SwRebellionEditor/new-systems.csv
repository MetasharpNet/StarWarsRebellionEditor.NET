Geology: Planet. Temperate, Varied
Species: Gados, Humans
Economy: Tertiary, Trade, Technology
History: Abregado-rae, also known simply as Abregado, is a trade world located in the galaxy's Core Worlds. It is situated at the beginning of the Rimma Trade Route.  During the High Republic Era, a countess living on Abregado-rae ordered a saberfish from Tibrin for her private aquarium, with it being transported to the Core in the starship Legacy Run. After the saberfish became ill due to her people not knowing how to care for it, the countess paid for the Run to return the fish to Tibrin. Unlike most Core Worlds, Abregado-rae was fairly backward, to the point of being compared with worlds in the Outer Rim Territories. The planet's spaceports seemed safe, at least to the untrained eye, but in fact it was a known smuggler's paradise.

In 20 BBY, the third year of the Clone Wars, the planet was under the control of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Count Dooku ordered General Kalani to retreat to Agamar following his defeat at the Onderonian Civil War to the Onderon rebels. Because of Kalani's override of the droid shutdown signal, an isolated Separatist holdout remained on the planet until well into the era of the Galactic Empire.

However, the scouts deliberately hid it from the Imperial Senate because it was short-listed as a potential home for a rebel base like Yavin 4 and Dantooine.

History: Originally a colony of the Sith Empire, its location was lost then rediscovered in 4980 BBY. The Emperor and the remnants of the shattered Sith society reconstituted the Sith Empire with Dromund Kaas as its capital. In 3640 BBY a Jedi Knight defeated there the Emperor in personal combat. The reconstituted Empire eventually dissolved before 2000 BBY. Several decades later the rogue Sith Lord Darth Millennial established the Dark Force religion on Dromund Kaas after he rejected the Rule of Two and abandoned the Order of the Sith Lords. The Prophets of the Dark Side who followed Millennial's religion ruled Dromund Kaas for almost a thousand years before they incurred the wrath of Darth Sidious, causing the Prophets to abandon the planet for Bosthirda. Despite its relative obscurity, the planet became embroiled in the galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, but the powerful influence of the dark side of the Force on Dromund Kaas continued to draw both Jedi and Sith to the planet over the next several decades.

The guild's affiliation with the Confederacy of Independent Systems caused Empress Teta to side against the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, while loyalist nobles fled to Coruscant. After the war ended with a Separatist defeat, the newly-formed Galactic Empire installed these nobles in positions of power, such as planetary bureaucrats or Mining Guild administrators. During the Galactic Civil War, the planet was ruled by Emperor Alor Keto, though he was largely an ineffectual puppet of the Mining Guild. Already a major supplier for the Imperial Military, Empress Teta assumed increased strategic importance for the Empire as its location restricted access to the Deep Core Security Zone, where the Empire tested experimental technologies such as Interdictors. The world was protected by Admiral Yzu's 15th Deep Core Reserve Fleet.

Only a few small, neat cities were necessary to cater for the needs of the state bureaucracy and the Consortium's commercial and legal institutions, and much of the planet was an unspoiled wilderness of broad oceans, snow-peaked mountains and lush primeval forest, where tightly-controlled commercial fisheries and game-preserves were the major focus of Hapan activity. Hapes was first settled by the Lorell Raiders, a group of pirates who had found routes through the Transitory Mists and used the Hapes Cluster as their base.
