History: Hapes is the homeworld of the Hapans, a near-Human race known for their beauty, and the administrative capital of the Hapes Consortium. Surrounded by shimmering nebulae, and with seven moons in the sky after sunset, Hapes never knew the darkness of true night, and the Hapan people had relatively poor night-vision. Only a few small, neat cities were necessary to cater for the needs of the state bureaucracy and the Consortium's commercial and legal institutions, and much of the planet was an unspoiled wilderness of broad oceans, snow-peaked mountains and lush primeval forest, where tightly-controlled commercial fisheries and game-preserves were the major focus of Hapan activity. Hapes was first settled by the Lorell Raiders, a group of pirates who had found routes through the Transitory Mists and used the Hapes Cluster as their base.

Prior to the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, Alderaanian scouts charted Ajan Kloss, which was located in a patchily explored stretch of space off the Celanon Spur. However, the scouts deliberately hid it from the Imperial Senate because it was short-listed as a potential home for a rebel base like Yavin 4 and Dantooine.

History: During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems sought the planet. Despite this, the planet remained neutral. Late in the war, Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent to investigate the death of Jedi Master Tu-Anh. This led them to locate a massive kyber crystal that the Confederacy was attempting to acquire. They were able to destroy the crystal before it could fall into Separatist hands. Within months, the Separatists invaded Utapau with thousands of battle droids. Later, a number of key Separatist leaders were stationed on the planet, but were moved to a mining complex on Mustafar prior to the battle on the orders of Darth Sidious. General Grievous remained on Utapau to oversee the battle, but met his end at the hands of Jedi Master Kenobi. Unfortunately for him, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine issued Order 66 shortly thereafter. Because of their behavioral modification biochips, Kenobi's clone troopers turned on their Jedi General and shot him down into a sinkhole. However, Kenobi survived and escaped Utapau. After the end of the Clone Wars, the Galactic Empire occupied the planet, leading to a number of Pau'an refugees left Utapau. In 13 BBY, the Pau'an medical students Fyzen Gor and Greesto Ftrak were abducted by the Wandering Star criminal organization. One of the gangsters shot Ftrak in the chest, and he fell into a coma. Gor later killed Ftrak by removing one of his arms, and attached it to a medical droid. Over the next two years, Gor built a small army of droids augmented with organic body parts, which drew Wandering Star's attention once more. Most of the droids were destroyed in a brief skirmish, and Gor was forced into the service of the gang.

Bentraal IV was a key foothold for the New Republic during the final days of the Galactic Civil War. It and other planets in the Bormea sector were defended by the New Republic's Vanguard Squadron.

Mothma, by that time the chancellor of the Alliance, recognized her homeworld's suffering but believed she could not let her personal biases get in the way of the Rebellion's decision making; with thousands of worlds suffering under Imperial rule, she could not simply decide to point their resources at helping the one planet.

History: Though the andris mines on Empress Teta were abandoned once they ran dry, the Mining Guild continued to assert control over the world and eventually usurped the power of the ruling Keto family in all but name. The guild's affiliation with the Confederacy of Independent Systems caused Empress Teta to side against the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, while loyalist nobles fled to Coruscant. After the war ended with a Separatist defeat, the newly-formed Galactic Empire installed these nobles in positions of power, such as planetary bureaucrats or Mining Guild administrators. During the Galactic Civil War, the planet was ruled by Emperor Alor Keto, though he was largely an ineffectual puppet of the Mining Guild. Already a major supplier for the Imperial Military, Empress Teta assumed increased strategic importance for the Empire as its location restricted access to the Deep Core Security Zone, where the Empire tested experimental technologies such as Interdictors. The world was protected by Admiral Yzu's 15th Deep Core Reserve Fleet.

However below the surface levels, the decaying lower levels were home to the poor and unfortunate citizens, along side the criminal gangs that ruled the undercity. Coruscant is also famous for being the former home of the jedi council and the site of a massive Jedi temple, which has now been repurposed as the Imperial palace.

History: At some point, Teth was inhabited by the B'omarr Order. However, by the time of the Clone Wars, their castles were abandoned, though some would be converted by the Hutts into formidable strongholds. Some distance from the B'omarr monasteries and the Tomb of Ziro the Hutt's father, an area of mysterious rock formations could be found on the surface of Teth.
