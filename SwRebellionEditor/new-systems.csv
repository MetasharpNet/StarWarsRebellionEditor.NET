History: Coruscant has been the governmental capital of the galaxy for generations. The planet's entire surface is covered by an enormous, multileveled city, called Imperial City, whose foundations have been in place since the beginning of the Old Republic, over a thousand generations ago. The pyramidal Imperial Palace, an impregnable fortress and home to the Emperor, is constructed of gray-green rock and sparkling crystals and is taller than all other structures including the Senate building. The lowest, darkest levels of Imperial City were abandoned long ago and are now home to discarded equipment, wrecked starships, and nameless subhumans moving through the shadows.
