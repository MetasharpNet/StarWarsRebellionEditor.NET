History: Gerrenthum, a relatively obscure world, witnesses considerable transformations. Its strategic importance grew as the Galactic Empire sought to tighten its grip on the galaxy. The Empire established a military presence, constructing installations and recruiting locals to bolster their forces. This led to a climate of tension and unrest among the inhabitants, who had previously enjoyed relative autonomy. As a result, resistance movements began to take shape, with some citizens rallying against the Empire's oppressive regime. Covert operations and sabotage attempts aimed to weaken Imperial influence, sparking a precarious balance of power. Throughout this period, Gerrenthum remained an important site of ongoing conflict and intrigue, with various factions vying for control.

History: Ghorman experiences a period of unrest and upheaval. As a site of historical significance, particularly due to the infamous Ghorman Massacre, the Galactic Empire maintained a strong presence to quell potential dissent. The Empire's grip on the world led to an increase in surveillance and security measures, causing tension among the local population. In response, underground resistance movements gained momentum, working in the shadows to challenge Imperial control. Acts of sabotage, intelligence gathering, and covert operations became increasingly common, as the resistance sought to destabilize the Empire's grip on Ghorman. Despite the ongoing conflict, the planet's inhabitants persevered, adapting to the changing political landscape while retaining their cultural identity.

Surrounded by shimmering nebulae, and with seven moons in the sky after sunset, Hapes never knew the darkness of true night, and the Hapan people had relatively poor night-vision. Only a few small, neat cities were necessary to cater for the needs of the state bureaucracy and the Consortium's commercial and legal institutions, and much of the planet was an unspoiled wilderness of broad oceans, snow-peaked mountains and lush primeval forest, where tightly-controlled commercial fisheries and game-preserves were the major focus of Hapan activity. Hapes was first settled by the Lorell Raiders, a group of pirates who had found routes through the Transitory Mists and used the Hapes Cluster as their base.

History: During the time of the Galactic Republic, Kaller remained an insulated world due largely to the native Kallerans' culture valuing individualism, rather than collective achievement. While Kaller hosted many different groups and species, no offworlders ever held absolute sway over the majority of the planet. Local Kalleran leaders worked behind the scenes to create rivalries between the offworlders that would better serve Kalleran politics. During the Clone Wars, the planet was targeted by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, with Count Dooku himself ordering General Kleeve to lead the conquest. After the general left the world of Kardoa, he oversaw the Separatist occupation of Kaller out of the compound of village leader Gamut Key. In 19 BBY, Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan Caleb Dume led their battalion of clone troopers against Kleeve's occupation of Kaller. Although Kleeve was forced into a retreat, the Kallerans were resistant to the campaign, seeing little difference between a Republic and Separatist occupation of the planet. After the Battle of Coruscant, Kaller was again a battleground, with Billaba, Dume, and their clones fighting battle droids alongside the elite squad Clone Force 99, which was the only reinforcement that could be sent due to the attack on the capital, Coruscant.

Planets such as Naboo dumped their trash there. Following his defeat at the Battle of Naboo, with his body shattered, the Sith Lord Darth Maul went into exile in the bowels of Lotho Minor, where he lost his mind. To escape the planet, he sent out a transmission, offering a great sum of credits for the capture of himself in hopes of luring a starship that he could escape in. The transmission was intercepted by the droid Captain Spikewheel and her crew of scavenger hopefuls; however, Maul's attempt to flee the planet failed. The crazed Sith was eventually found by his brother, Savage Opress, over a decade after the former's defeat on Naboo.

The first year of the Clone Wars, Mimban was invaded by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Mud Jumpers of the Grand Army of the Republics 224th Division armed and trained the Mimbanese Liberation Army, promising them freedom when the Separatist Droid Army was repelled. After the clone wars, the Galactic Empire sent the 224th division who had previously helped defend the world, to subjugate it and make the planets resources available to the empire.

It was believed to have existed outside any star system, and potentially the galaxy or even the universe. Some believed that the origins of the Force came from Mortis. During the Clone Wars, the Father drew Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano into the realm from the Chrelythiumn system. The Father realized that Skywalker was the prophesized Chosen One, and that he could maintain the balance of the Force between the two children once the Father died. This led to a struggle between the Force wielders and the three Jedi, culminating in the deaths of all three wielders and the restoration of balance on Mortis. The ethereal realm shared its name with the Phases of Mortis, a solution to the Unsolved Theorem of Master Thorpe that was included in the sacred Jedi texts.

History: Once a garden world nourished by the Bright Star artifact, Mustafar orbit was shifted when Lady Corvax unleashed the energies of the Bright Star in an attempt to return her husband to life. The resulting gravimetric duel between the gas giants Jestefad and Lefrani over Mustafar heated the planet's core, transforming the lush world into an imbalanced volcanic hellscape. Legends of Corvax's search for immortality brought the ancient Sith to Mustafar, seeking the same secrets of eternal life. There, they built a temple over a locus in the dark side of the Force, above the buried ruins of Corvax Fortress. Acquired by the Techno Union over three hundred years before the Clone Wars, Mustafar's lava flows were mined for unique and valuable minerals. It was also home to the Black Sun crime syndicate, whose headquarters was located near the mining town that became known as Zitontown after the Falleen Ziton Moj ascended to leadership of the organization. During the Clone Wars, the Mustafarians aligned themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who used Mustafar to produce battle droids for their droid army. Darth Sidious had a secret facility on the planet where he intended to turn ""harvested"" Force-sensitive children into Force-talented spies. However, the Sith Lord had the base scuttled when Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, arrived to rescue the younglings. Mustafar served as the final redoubt of the Separatist Council until the newly-appointed Darth Vader, formerly Anakin Skywalker, was sent by Sidious to slaughter the council, effectively ending the Clone Wars. The Sith Lord was confronted by his wife, Padmé Amidala, and his former Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. The latter dueled Vader, defeating him and leaving him to burn on a lava bank. However, Vader was saved when Sidious arrived and carried him offworld. Mustafar then came under the ownership of the Galactic Empire after the Techno Union and its assets were nationalized. Sidious had new facilities built on the planet, where more Force-sensitive infants were taken and transformed into agents of the Inquisitorius.

History: Naboo is a beautiful and peaceful world in the mid rim. The planet is ruled by an elected monarch, but it is firmly committed to democracy and peace . Fleeing a brutal civil war, a group of humans from the planet Grizmallt crash-landed on Naboo and set up a small colony. As they established their own society, they initially kept separate from the Gungans. When the colonists made contact with the Gungans, tensions arose between the two peoples, culminating a series of wars between the two species. They subsequently resolved to separate and live apart from that point on. Conflict between Humans and the Gungans were only recently resolved after the battle of Naboo, where they joined forces to drive away an invasion force of the Trade federation. Naboo recovered quickly from the invasion under Queen Amidala's rule, managing to almost completely restore its harvests and crop yields by the end of her final term. One of Amidala's final projects, which continued under the reign of her successor, was the implementation of an ion pulse in Theed in case of future invasions. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire and Palpatine's self-proclamation as Emperor, Naboo hosted one of the new regime's military garrisons. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, thousands of citizens gathered in the streets of Theed in order to assist to Amidala's funeral procession.

History: Around 296 BBY, the Nagai were reaching the height of their civilization, and were beginning to experiment with rudimentary hyperspace technology. An unmanned probe sent to explore the other planets of their star system, however, was detected by a Tof warship. The Tofs found Nagi an easy target for their depredations and immediately set about conquering the planet and enslaving the Nagai. The Nagai fought back, however, and unlike previous victims of the Tofs, survived not only the initial attack but also three hundred years of Tof oppression. Enough Nagai evaded the Tofs to devote their remaining resources to defense and space travel, sending scouts into the galaxy to find targets for their own conquest. Finding the Galactic Empire and Rebellion at war, the Nagai scout Krai H'voc advised waiting until the defeat of the Empire before advancing on the rest of the galaxy. The Nagai allied with an Imperial splinter group under the command of Lumiya and fought on many worlds before Tof pursuers forced the Nagai into a peace agreement with the Alliance of Free Planets, successor of the Rebellion. They defeated the invading Tof forces at Saijo, and while some Nagai chose to remain in the greater galaxy, the Nagai expeditionary force, along with Mandalore Fenn Shysa and his contingent of Mandalorian resistance fighters, returned to Nagi to fight the Tofs still holding their homeworld.

As the population grew, an increasing percentage of the arriving settlers began to include less savory visitors, such as tax evaders, smugglers, and those working on the black market. By the time of the Clone Wars, Ord Mantell became home to a large base for the Black Sun crime syndicate. Nevertheless, in the years following the Battle of Geonosis, the planet housed a storage facility, barracks, and fleet support base for the Republic's Grand Army and Navy.

During the reign of the Galactic Empire, an Imperial outpost was located on Rhen Var. After the stolen Imperial corvette Carrion Spike attacked Imperial facilities in the Galidraan star system, the planet's outpost was considered as one of the potential targets for the corvette by Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. Due to the relative unimportance of the outpost on Rhen Var, Tarkin decided that the Imperial assets on the planet Nam Chorios were a more likely choice for the rebel cell piloting the stolen starship.
