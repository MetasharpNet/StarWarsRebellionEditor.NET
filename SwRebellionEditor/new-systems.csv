Species: Gados, Humans

History: Abregado-rae, also known simply as Abregado, is a trade world located in the galaxy's Core Worlds. It was situated at the beginning of the Rimma Trade Route. Abregado-rae had the reputation to be a rather lawless world, and its main spaceport was as close to a safe dock for smugglers as could be found in the Core.

During the High Republic Era, a countess living on Abregado-rae ordered a saberfish from Tibrin for her private aquarium, with it being transported to the Core in the starship Legacy Run. After the saberfish became ill due to her people not knowing how to care for it, the countess paid for the Run to return the fish to Tibrin.  

[Legends] Unlike most Core Worlds, Abregado-rae was fairly backward, to the point of being compared with worlds in the Outer Rim Territories. The planet's spaceports seemed safe, at least to the untrained eye, but in fact it was a known smuggler's paradise.

In 20 BBY, the third year of the Clone Wars, the planet was under the control of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Count Dooku ordered General Kalani to retreat to Agamar following his defeat at the Onderonian Civil War to the Onderon rebels. Because of Kalani's override of the droid shutdown signal, an isolated Separatist holdout remained on the planet until well into the era of the Galactic Empire.

History: Ajan Kloss was a jungle moon located in the Outer Rim Territories, in grid square L-5 on the Standard Galactic Grid, orbiting the gas giant Ajara. Although Ajan Kloss was a moon, it has two moons of its own. Its gas giant shields it from harmful radiation.

The world was inhabited by a people called the Kloss lived in the Klosslands and hollowed-out caves. 

Prior to the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, Alderaanian scouts charted Ajan Kloss, which was located in a patchily explored stretch of space off the Celanon Spur. However, the scouts deliberately hid it from the Imperial Senate because it was short-listed as a potential home for a rebel base like Yavin 4 and Dantooine.

Tibanna gas is harvested and refined in several mining complexes, including Cloud City, an opulent metropolis suspended in the planet's huge billowing clouds.

Bespin was home to many types of life, which was rare for a gas giant. The planet had two sister worlds, from which it was separated by an asteroid belt called Velser's Ring.

History: Anaxes, was an ancient member of the Galactic Republic, hosting a Republic naval base protecting the Core Worlds from attacks along the Perlemian, as well as prominent shipyards. For centuries, it primarily worked with local defense forces.

After the Clone Wars, Anaxes was destroyed by a cataclysmic event, believed to be the result of a catastrophic main reactor failure detonating a massive stockpile of hypermatter in the shipyards. All that remained of the planet was an asteroid belt. Fort Anaxes, a Republic Military base constructed on Anaxes during the Clone Wars, survived the planet's destruction and remained on the planetoid PM-1203.

History: Coruscant has been the governmental capital of the galaxy for generations. The planet's entire surface is covered by an enormous, multileveled city, called Imperial City, whose foundations have been in place since the beginning of the Old Republic, over a thousand generations ago. The pyramidal Imperial Palace, an impregnable fortress and home to the Emperor, is constructed of gray-green rock and sparkling crystals and is taller than all other structures including the Senate building. The lowest, darkest levels of Imperial City were abandoned long ago and are now home to discarded equipment, wrecked starships, and nameless subhumans moving through the shadows.

A major trade world, Bothawui is the center of the trade of technology in its sector and is the home of many trade houses and mega-corporations, while also boasting strong shipping, communication, and transportation industries.

[Legends] Assassinations, espionage, and sabotage were as commonplace on Bothawui as debates and typical legislation were on other worlds, and the Bothan Spynet developed into the foremost information-gathering network in the galaxy because of the suspicious and treacherous nature of life on Bothawui.

[Legends] Bothawui remained neutral during the clone wars, and has negotiated limited independence from the Galactic Empire.

History: Kamino is an aquatic planet located in a remote star system in the outskirts of the galaxy. It is inhabited by the Kaminoans. They are a race of tall, elegant beings with long necks who tended to keep to themselves. They are also known for their cloning technology, which was used to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic.

At some point the planet was not covered in water, and the Kaminoans built a large land-based civilization. However, the water level rose, forcing the Kaminoans to build their structures on stilts. Kamino often experienced heavy rain, and during some parts of the year was covered with heavy electrical storms. During this season, Kaminoans rode on aiwhas underwater and resurfaced once they were near their destination.

Shortly after the establishment of the Galactic Empire, Imperial Governor and Admiral Wilhuff Tarkin arrived on Kamino to discuss the status of the new Imperial Army with Lama Su. Tarkin informed the Prime Minister that the Empire was reluctant to continuing using clones. The Empire slowly dismantled the cloning program as the troops in the Imperial Army were gradually replaced by non-clone recruits
