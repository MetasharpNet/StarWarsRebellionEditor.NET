History: Bothawui was considered to be strategically important during the Clone Wars, leading to it being the site of a battle between Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and General Grievous that halted a Separatist advance. Later in the war, around the time the Galactic Republic suffered a loss on Ryloth, Bothawui hosted another battle, though this engagement ended with many Republic losses. Several of the individuals who taught the human Wilhuff Tarkin to fly starships originated on this world, despite the great distance between the world and the planet Eriadu where Tarkin lived. Many years later, Imperial resources were redirected from Bothawui by the Imperial Navy to help deal with Tarkin's corvette, Carrion Spike, after it was stolen by dissidents.

History: Though the andris mines on Empress Teta were abandoned once they ran dry, the Mining Guild continued to assert control over the world and eventually usurped the power of the ruling Keto family in all but name. The guild's affiliation with the Confederacy of Independent Systems caused Empress Teta to side against the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, while loyalist nobles fled to Coruscant. After the war ended with a Separatist defeat, the newly-formed Galactic Empire installed these nobles in positions of power, such as planetary bureaucrats or Mining Guild administrators. During the Galactic Civil War, the planet was ruled by Emperor Alor Keto, though he was largely an ineffectual puppet of the Mining Guild. Already a major supplier for the Imperial Military, Empress Teta assumed increased strategic importance for the Empire as its location restricted access to the Deep Core Security Zone, where the Empire tested experimental technologies such as Interdictors. The world was protected by Admiral Yzu's 15th Deep Core Reserve Fleet.

History: During the time of the Galactic Republic, Kaller remained an insulated world due largely to the native Kallerans' culture valuing individualism, rather than collective achievement. While Kaller hosted many different groups and species, no offworlders ever held absolute sway over the majority of the planet. Local Kalleran leaders worked behind the scenes to create rivalries between the offworlders that would better serve Kalleran politics. During the Clone Wars, the planet was targeted by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, with Count Dooku himself ordering General Kleeve to lead the conquest. After the general left the world of Kardoa, he oversaw the Separatist occupation of Kaller out of the compound of village leader Gamut Key. In 19 BBY, Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan Caleb Dume led their battalion of clone troopers against Kleeve's occupation of Kaller. Although Kleeve was forced into a retreat, the Kallerans were resistant to the campaign, seeing little difference between a Republic and Separatist occupation of the planet. After the Battle of Coruscant, Kaller was again a battleground, with Billaba, Dume, and their clones fighting battle droids alongside the elite squad Clone Force 99, which was the only reinforcement that could be sent due to the attack on the capital, Coruscant.

History: Ord Mantell was colonized by settlers from the Core World planet Corellia during the middle era of the Galactic Republic's expansion. As the Republic grew in territory size, the planet's strategic significance was lost, but civilian cargo trade began to grow due to the presence of a military-grade shipyard and drydocks. rd Mantell became notable as a trading post for spacers who traveled west of the Hydian Way super-hyperroute. As the population grew, an increasing percentage of the arriving settlers began to include less savory visitors, such as tax evaders, smugglers, and those working on the black market. By the time of the Clone Wars, Ord Mantell became home to a large base for the Black Sun crime syndicate. Nevertheless, in the years following the Battle of Geonosis, the planet housed a storage facility, barracks, and fleet support base for the Republic's Grand Army and Navy. Additionally, Ord Mantell served as the headquarters for the Republic's 8th Sector Army. All of this served to define Ord Mantell as an important planet for the Republic.

Fleeing a brutal civil war, a group of humans from the planet Grizmallt crash-landed on Naboo and set up a small colony. As they established their own society, they initially kept separate from the Gungans. When the colonists made contact with the Gungans, tensions arose between the two peoples, culminating a series of wars between the two species. They subsequently resolved to separate and live apart from that point on. Conflict between Humans and the Gungans were only recently resolved after the battle of Naboo, where they joined forces to drive away an invasion force of the Trade federation. Naboo recovered quickly from the invasion under Queen Amidala's rule, managing to almost completely restore its harvests and crop yields by the end of her final term. One of Amidala's final projects, which continued under the reign of her successor, was the implementation of an ion pulse in Theed in case of future invasions. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire and Palpatine's self-proclamation as Emperor, Naboo hosted one of the new regime's military garrisons. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, thousands of citizens gathered in the streets of Theed in order to assist to Amidala's funeral procession.

The Father realized that Skywalker was the prophesized Chosen One, and that he could maintain the balance of the Force between the two children once the Father died. This led to a struggle between the Force wielders and the three Jedi, culminating in the deaths of all three wielders and the restoration of balance on Mortis.

History: Once a garden world nourished by the Bright Star artifact, Mustafar orbit was shifted when Lady Corvax unleashed the energies of the Bright Star in an attempt to return her husband to life. The resulting gravimetric duel between the gas giants Jestefad and Lefrani over Mustafar heated the planet's core, transforming the lush world into an imbalanced volcanic hellscape. Legends of Corvax's search for immortality brought the ancient Sith to Mustafar, seeking the same secrets of eternal life. There, they built a temple over a locus in the dark side of the Force, above the buried ruins of Corvax Fortress. Acquired by the Techno Union over three hundred years before the Clone Wars, Mustafar's lava flows were mined for unique and valuable minerals. It was also home to the Black Sun crime syndicate, whose headquarters was located near the mining town that became known as Zitontown after the Falleen Ziton Moj ascended to leadership of the organization. During the Clone Wars, the Mustafarians aligned themselves with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who used Mustafar to produce battle droids for their droid army. Darth Sidious had a secret facility on the planet where he intended to turn ""harvested"" Force-sensitive children into Force-talented spies. However, the Sith Lord had the base scuttled when Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, arrived to rescue the younglings. Mustafar served as the final redoubt of the Separatist Council until the newly-appointed Darth Vader, formerly Anakin Skywalker, was sent by Sidious to slaughter the council, effectively ending the Clone Wars. The Sith Lord was confronted by his wife, Padmé Amidala, and his former Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. The latter dueled Vader, defeating him and leaving him to burn on a lava bank. However, Vader was saved when Sidious arrived and carried him offworld. Mustafar then came under the ownership of the Galactic Empire after the Techno Union and its assets were nationalized. Sidious had new facilities built on the planet, where more Force-sensitive infants were taken and transformed into agents of the Inquisitorius.

During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Empire, deeming Endor to be perfect for its purposes due to how remote the moon was,[25] established an outpost on the moon that included a shield generator complex to protect the incomplete second Death Star in orbit of the moon. In order to make way for the complex, an Ewok village was razed by Imperial troops, leading to strained Imperial—Ewok relations. As a result of the repulsorlift field emitted by the SLD-26 planetary shield generator to keep the Death Star in a stationary orbit, Endor was prone to earthquakes, tidal imbalances, and other geological disturbances that slowly but surely began to break up the small moon.

History: Lotho Minor, also known as the Junk World, is a ruined planet. It was discovered early in the history of the Galactic Republic. As one of the galaxy's dumping grounds, Lotho Minor's surface was covered with mountains of trash amassed over untold generations, which brought salvage operations to the planet in search of machinery that could still be repurposed. Planets such as Naboo dumped their trash there. Following his defeat at the Battle of Naboo, with his body shattered, the Sith Lord Darth Maul went into exile in the bowels of Lotho Minor, where he lost his mind. To escape the planet, he sent out a transmission, offering a great sum of credits for the capture of himself in hopes of luring a starship that he could escape in. The transmission was intercepted by the droid Captain Spikewheel and her crew of scavenger hopefuls; however, Maul's attempt to flee the planet failed. The crazed Sith was eventually found by his brother, Savage Opress, over a decade after the former's defeat on Naboo. During the Galactic Civil War, the Duros Akar Duel ruled over a collection of monster droids built from Lotho Minor's scrap and claimed the planet as his own, but his servants turned against him and gained their freedom following an encounter with the Rebel Alliance droid C-3PO.

The Prophets of the Dark Side who followed Millennial's religion ruled Dromund Kaas for almost a thousand years before they incurred the wrath of Darth Sidious, causing the Prophets to abandon the planet for Bosthirda. Despite its relative obscurity, the planet became embroiled in the galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, but the powerful influence of the dark side of the Force on Dromund Kaas continued to draw both Jedi and Sith to the planet over the next several decades.
