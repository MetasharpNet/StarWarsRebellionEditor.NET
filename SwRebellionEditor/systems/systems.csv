The Galactic Empire's collapse provided an opportunity for the criminal underworld to further solidify its influence on Nevarro, attracting a diverse array of individuals seeking refuge or opportunities. Despite the ongoing conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the remnants of the Empire, Nevarro's remote location and lack of strategic significance left it relatively undisturbed, allowing the planet to continue serving as a hub for those living outside the law.
