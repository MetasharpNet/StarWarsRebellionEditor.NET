## Star Wars Rebellion Editor .NET

This C# 11.0 project is built with .NET 7 in Visual Studio 2022 : https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

The project is going under a heavy cleanup phase. So don't inspect the code as if it was "ready to receive new features" yet.

Runtime can be downloaded here : https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0
